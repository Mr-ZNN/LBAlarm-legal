    <ul>
      <li>Subscriptions may automatically renew unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.</li>
      <li>You can manage or cancel subscriptions in your device settings (Apple ID → Subscriptions).</li>
      <li>We do not issue refunds directly; refunds are handled according to Apple’s policies.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. No Medical or Emergency Use</h2>
    <p>
      The App is provided for convenience and general use (e.g., alarms, reminders). It is not guaranteed to wake you up in all situations
      and should not be relied on for critical, medical, or emergency purposes.

    <h2>5. Availability and Changes</h2>
    <p>
      We may update, modify, suspend, or discontinue the App (or parts of it) at any time.
      We may also update these Terms. Continued use after changes means you accept the updated Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>
      The App is provided on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis. To the maximum extent permitted by law,
